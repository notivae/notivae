# üîê Authentication

Notivae offers a flexible and self-contained authentication system, giving you full control over user data and login flows. It supports both traditional account-based login and external [OAuth/OIDC identity providers](#oauth--oidc-authentication).

## Username Support

Users can log in using either:

* Email address
* Or a unique **username** (set during sign-up)

For email/password login details, refer to [Password-based Authentication](./password.md).

## OAuth / OIDC Authentication

Notivae supports logging in via third-party identity providers using the OIDC protocol. This enables users to authenticate without managing passwords directly.

Supported providers include:

- [Discord](./discord.md) <small>(Planned)</small>
- [GitHub](./github.md) <small>(Planned)</small>
- [GitLab](./gitlab.md) <small>(Planned)</small>
- [Google](./google.md) <small>(Planned)</small>
- [Reddit](./reddit.md) <small>(Planned)</small>
- [Spotify](./spotify.md) <small>(Planned)</small>
- [Twitch](./twitch.md) <small>(Planned)</small>
- Any identity provider compliant with [OpenID Connect](./oidc.md)

> [!TIP] Workaround
> While most providers aren't officially supported yet, many can still be used via generic OIDC configuration.  
> For example, Discord and GitLab are OIDC compatible and can be manually integrated:
> ```dotenv
> OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<your discord application's client ID>
> OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your discord application's client secret>
> OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=https://discord.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
> OIDC_SCOPES="identity email"
> OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME="Discord"
> ```

### Setup Example (GitLab)

```dotenv
GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GITLAB_ISSUER=https://gitlab.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

More providers will be documented with exact values and setup instructions once the integration layer stabilizes.

## System Management

A **system admin account** is created during the initial setup. This account has full access to all instance-level configuration and user management features.

## Session Management

Sessions are handled using secure HTTP-only cookies. No client-side tokens are stored in `localStorage` or exposed to JavaScript. All tokens are cryptographically signed and validated on the backend to ensure integrity and security.

## Planned Features

* Email verification and password reset flows
* Admin UI for user management (per instance)
* Optional 2FA support (TOTP-based)
* SSO login restrictions (e.g. only allow GitHub org members)
