## 📖 What is Notivae?

**Notivae** is a **self-hosted**, **real-time collaborative markdown editor** built for **students**, **researchers**, and **professionals** who value structure, clarity, and ownership of their knowledge.

Inspired by Latin roots meaning “related to notes”, Notivae empowers users to **write**, **collaborate**, and **organize** their thoughts in a flexible but structured environment — all without giving up control to third-party platforms.

Whether you're managing **study notes**, **drafting papers**, **planning projects**, or building a long-term **knowledge base**, Notivae helps you stay productive and in control.

### 🧠 Key Capabilities

- **Markdown-first experience** — Focused, clean writing interface powered by a modern Markdown engine.
- **Real-time collaboration** — CRDT-based multi-user editing with zero merge conflicts.
- **Hierarchical structure** — Nest documents within collections and subfolders to mirror your mental model.
- **Snapshots for versioning** — Create named snapshots of documents to mark stable revisions, much like commits in Git.
- **Inline comments** — Add and resolve context-specific feedback for discussion and peer review.
- **Granular access control** — Share documents via public links or restrict access with per-user permissions.
- **Offline support** — Fully functional offline editing with automatic background sync when reconnected.
- **Authentication options** — Sign in via email/password or OAuth providers like GitHub, GitLab, Discord, and any OIDC-compatible system.
- **Fully self-hosted** — No reliance on external services like Supabase, S3, or Firebase. Your data stays yours.
- **Early-stage roadmap** — Planned features include a user dashboard, export to PDF/Markdown, comment threads, mobile improvements, and API support.

> [!NOTE] ✨ Built with ❤️ by and for students who believe that knowledge should be open, structured, and self-owned.
