# 🚀 Introduction to Notivae

## Why Notivae?

Notivae was created to solve the limitations of existing knowledge and note-taking platforms. Tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), and [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) each offer parts of the solution—but not the whole. Some are closed-source, cloud-dependent, or hard to self-host. Others lack real-time collaboration, structured access control, or robust offline support.

Notivae brings together the best of these systems while staying **fully self-hosted**, **markdown-native**, and **privacy-first**.
