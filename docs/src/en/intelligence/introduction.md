The **Intelligence module** is an optional service that enhances Notivae with AI/ML-powered capabilities ‚Äî all running locally on the user‚Äôs system. When enabled, this module allows users to automate, analyze, and organize their content more effectively using machine learning techniques.  

This service is completely self-contained and runs in a separate container. Users who prefer a lightweight or privacy-focused setup can simply choose not to install or enable it.  

## ‚ú® Intelligent Content Features

These features are designed to assist with content creation, cleanup, and refinement:

- **Reviewer**  
  Analyzes a document and recommends:
  - Grammar and spelling corrections
  - Stylistic rewrites
  - Clarity improvements

- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**  
  Converts images (e.g., scans, handwritten notes, photos of slides) into searchable, editable text.  
  Useful for:
  - Better document indexing and search
  - Extracting text from screenshots or PDFs

- **Auto-title Generator**  
  Suggests meaningful titles for untitled documents.  
  May also recommend improved or standardized titles for renamed files.

- **Automatic Tag Suggestion**  
  Analyzes the content of a document and suggests relevant tags to improve organization and discoverability.  
  Suggestions are based on:
  - Keyword extraction
  - Semantic understanding of the text
  - Cross-referencing existing tags across the workspace

  This helps reduce manual tagging effort and promotes consistency in tag usage.

- **Version Diff Summarization**  
  Generates a natural language summary describing what has changed between different versions of a document.

- **Smart Paste**  
  When pasting content into a document, this feature can:
  - Automatically clean up formatting
  - Summarize large blocks of text
  - Extract key points or quotes

## üîç Search & Organization

Enhancements that help structure and navigate large volumes of notes and documents:

- **Semantic Search**  
  Goes beyond keyword search by understanding the *meaning* of queries and document content.  
  Enables searching for concepts, not just exact terms.

- **Topic Clustering**  
  Automatically groups related documents based on shared themes or subjects.  
  Ideal for organizing notes across broad topics or courses.

## üéôÔ∏è Audio & Speech

Advanced tools for working with voice data and recordings:

- **Audio-to-Text Transcription**  
  Converts spoken content (e.g. meeting recordings, lectures) into text for documentation or further processing.

- **Meeting Summarization & Tagging**  
  Automatically identifies key moments and tags from recorded discussions.  
  Can generate summaries or action items.

## üß© Architecture Note

All features are intended to:
- Run locally (no cloud dependency)
- Be modular and optional
- Be securely accessed via the main Notivae backend
- Respect user resources ‚Äî features are only triggered intentionally or in controlled background tasks
