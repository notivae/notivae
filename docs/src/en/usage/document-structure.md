# @icon:file-text Document Structure

Notivae’s power lies in how you can organize your knowledge into clear, nested structures — making it easy to find, edit, and collaborate on content.

## Documents and Collections

- **Collections** are like folders. They help you group related documents logically. (e.g. `Work` or `Studies`)
- **Documents** contain the actual markdown content.

Each user’s workspace holds multiple collections, and each collection contains multiple documents.

## Nesting Documents

Documents can be **nested inside other documents** to create deep hierarchies that mirror your thinking or project needs.

Example:

```
📁 Programming Notes
 ┣ 📄 Languages
 ┃ ┣ 📄 Rust
 ┃ ┗ 📄 Python
 ┣ 📄 Tools
 ┃ ┗ 📄 Docker
 ┗ 📄 Personal Roadmap
```

This lets you structure your notes as folders and subfolders, but within the markdown document hierarchy.

## Benefits of Nested Structure

- Organize large knowledge bases clearly
- Focus on small, manageable documents while keeping the big picture
- Enable granular access control at different hierarchy levels (planned)
- Support versioning and snapshots per document

## Navigation and UI

Notivae’s UI reflects this hierarchy with:

- Sidebar trees to browse collections and documents
- Breadcrumbs for context inside nested documents
- Quick search to jump between documents

By structuring your knowledge this way, Notivae helps you maintain clarity, context, and control over your content — whether you’re working solo or collaborating.
